<!-- 
1. Input Validation:
        Add input validation to ensure that user-provided data (such as employee IDs) meets certain criteria (e.g., positive integers, non-empty names).
        Handle invalid inputs gracefully by displaying appropriate error messages.

2. Menu System:
        Create a more robust menu system with additional options (e.g., update employee details, delete an employee, search by ID or name).
        Implement switch-case or if-else constructs to handle different menu choices.

3. Persistence:
        Store employee data in a file (e.g., CSV, JSON) so that it persists across program executions.
        Implement methods to read from and write to the file.

4. Sorting and Searching:
        Add functionality to sort employees based on their names or employee IDs.
        Implement search functionality to find employees by name or ID.

5. Additional Employee Information:
        Extend the Employee class to include more attributes (e.g., department, job title, hire date).
        Modify the constructor and other methods accordingly.

6. Inheritance and Polymorphism:
        Create subclasses (e.g., Manager, Developer) that inherit from the Employee class.
        Override methods (e.g., toString()) in the subclasses to customize behavior.

7. User Interface:
        Explore graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using libraries like JavaFX or Swing.
        Design a user-friendly interface for adding, displaying, and managing employees.

8. Unit Testing:
        Write unit tests for your Employee class to verify its correctness.
        Use testing frameworks like JUnit.

9. Exception Handling:
        Handle exceptions (e.g., NumberFormatException, InputMismatchException) gracefully.
        Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions.

10. Localization:
        If you’re interested in internationalization, consider adding support for multiple languages (localization) in your program.

Remember that the goal is not just to add features but also to understand how different concepts (such as OOP, file I/O, and exception handling) work together. Feel free to choose one or more of these ideas and explore further!
